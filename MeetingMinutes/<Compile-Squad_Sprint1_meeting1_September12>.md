### During the Meeting:
1. People who are familiar with the process will create the repository. Those who are not yet familiar need to create their accounts to ensure that everyone has access to the repository.
2. We also decided to create a Discord server to facilitate communication.
3. For the front-end, we chose **React**, and for the back-end, we decided to use **Django**.
4. We decided to divide the tasks based on each person's familiarity with different programming languages and their comfort level with more complex tasks, such as database management and back-end development.
