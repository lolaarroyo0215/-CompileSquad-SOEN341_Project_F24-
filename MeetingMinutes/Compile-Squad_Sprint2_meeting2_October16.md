### Meeting Notes:  
We reviewed the previous meeting, and everyone knows what they need to do. Here’s what we started:  

- **Lilia and Lola:** fixing the cookie setup.  
- **Sofia:** needs to complete the database documentation so Arman and Maria can access it and start their work.  
- **Arman and Maria:** have worked on the user stories.  
- **Ishika:** is waiting for other parts to begin her work.  

Our main challenge is that Arman and Maria are not yet familiar with setting up the database. Additionally, Lilia and Lola are also not familiar with fixing the cookie setup.
